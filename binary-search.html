<h1>Binary Search</h1>

<p>
    We last examined how you might search for an element in an unordered collection and learned that in the worst
    case, we could end up examining every element in the collection before finding it or determining that it is not
    present at all.
</p>

<p>But can we do better?</p>

<p>
    Consider a phone book. While these may very well be relics of days of yore,
    they still serve as a perfect analogue today to a more efficient search strategy.
</p>

    Before the days of the Internet and smartphones, if you wanted to call up "John Smith", you might have had to
    whip out one of these rotund tomes. A naive approach to doing so might involve thumbing through each page one by
    one and looking at each name until we've found our match. But these <strong>T H I C C</strong> books could
    easily contain upwards of 1,000 pages! This probably isn't the greatest use of your time.
</p>

<p>
    We could do better by turning two pages at a time. This would speed the process up considerably and effectively
    cut our search time in half. There's a chance we could accidentally skip over John Smith's name, and this could
    easily be remedied by simply turning one page back if we've missed him.
</p>

<p>
    But there's still a problem with this approach. Let's say that for whatever reason, an updated revision of the
    phone book was released containing contact information for all the residents in your town in addition to the
    next municipality over, effectively doubling in size. Our supposedly more efficient search algorithm would end up
    taking as long as our
    original sequential search strategy. We could increase the number of pages we skip over, but this also results in
    needing
    to backtrack more pages should we miss our target. And considering that any efficiency gained by skipping pages is
    offset linearly by
    the addition of more contacts, this seems more like a band-aid solution.
</p>

<p>
    Fortunately, most of us would not do things this way, for we can use the fact that phone books are <b>sorted</b>
    alphabetically to our advantage.
</p>

<p>As you probably do intuitively, if you wanted to search for "John Smith" in the phone book, you might first open
    the book to approximately the halfway point and see how close you are to your target.
    This would likely land you somewhere in the "M's" or "N's". Since "S" comes after either of those two letters,
    we know that Mr. Smith's name must lie somewhere in the right half of the phone book.
    By extension, we can now effectively discard the left half. Then we would repeat the process on the right half
    of the book, opening it halfway between our bisect point and the end. This might land us in the "T's". Since S
    comes before T, we know that our target now lies somewhere to the left of the book, and we can disregard all the
    pages to the
    right.</p>

<p>
    We would repeat this process until we've either landed on a page with John Smith's name, or until we've narrowed
    our search down to one page. At this point, if John Smith's name is not on this page, we can conclude he is not
    in the phone book.
</p>

<p>Our <b>binary search</b> algorithm for a phone book might look like the following:</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        If no pages
        <ul>
            <li>Return false</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
        If name is found on page
        <ul>
            <li>Return true</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
        Else if name comes before current page
        <ul>
            <li>Search left half of phone book</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
        Else if name comes after current page
        <ul>
            <li>Search right half of phone book</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
</ul>

<p>
    How much time did this save us? Notice that we are repeatedly cutting our problem in <b>half</b> each time with this
    algorithm. Searching a 1,000-page phone book with this approach would take ⌊log<sub>2</sub>1000 + 1⌋, or <b>10</b>
    steps. Compare that to our sequential approach which could take up to <b>1,000</b> steps and it isn't hard to see
    that binary search is
    clearly superior.
</p>

<p>
    If we doubled the size of our phone book, finding a contact using linear search would now take <b>2,000</b> steps.
    On
    the other hand, a binary search would only take <b>one</b> additional step, or <b>11</b> steps.
    <br>This is because ⌊log<sub>2</sub>(2 * 1000) + 1⌋ = ⌊log<sub>2</sub>2 + log<sub>2</sub>1000 + 1⌋ = ⌊1 +
    log<sub>2</sub>1000 + 1⌋
</p>

<p>
    We can now apply this same concept to data structures such as arrays. Again, a key prerequisite for this algorithm
    is that the array's elements must be in <b>sorted</b> order. First, we set left and right pointers to each end of
    the array and calculate the midpoint (which can be arbitrarily chosen if we have an even number of elements). We
    then look at the midpoint element. If there is a match, we've found our element. If our target is less than the
    midpoint element, we move our
    right pointer just left of the midpoint, which will now serve as our new upper bound. Conversely, if our target is
    greater than the midpoint
    element, we move our left pointer just right of the midpoint, serving as our new lower bound. We then calculate a
    new midpoint and repeat this process until either we have found our target or our two pointers intersect one
    another, at which point we can conclude
    the target is not in the array
</p>

<p>A sample Python implementation is shown below.</p>

<div class="codebox">
    <pre>
    <code>
        def bin_search(a_list, target) -> bool:
        """
        Searches a list for the parameterized target value and returns True if it is found and False if it is not.
        """

        # Set start and end points
        first = 0
        last = len(a_list) - 1

        # Repeat until start and end pointers intersect
        while first <= last:

            # Calculate bisect point (this particular formula prevents potential overflow errors)
            midpoint = first + (last - first) // 2

            # If the target is found at the midpoint, return True
            if a_list[midpoint] == target:
                return True

            # If the midpoint value is larger than the target, search the left half of the array
            elif a_list[midpoint] > target:
                last = midpoint - 1

            # If the midpoint value is less than the target, search the right half of the array
            else:
                first = midpoint + 1

        return False
    </code>
